"""
Suite 5: Abandoned Checkout Concession & Anti-Gaming Margin Protection.
Validates:
- Strict policy denial of discounts on invoices and recurring subscriptions
- Bounded bell-curve concession margin calculation (5% to 30%)
- Initial outreach with hydrated discounted checkout link
- Multi-turn inbound conversational negotiation via LLM
- Anti-gaming enforcement: customer haggle never exceeds pre-approved margin ceiling
